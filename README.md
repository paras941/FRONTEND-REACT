This document explains the structure, usage, and logic behind the **components**, **props**, and **custom hooks** used in this React project.

## 🧩 Components.

Components are the core building blocks of a React application. Each one is designed to be **modular**, **reusable**, and **easy to maintain**.

### 📁 Folder Structure

A standard organization might look like:


### Description

* Each component should be self-contained with its logic, styles, and optional tests.
* The naming convention for components follows **PascalCase**.
* Components should remain **pure**, meaning they focus on rendering UI based on the data (props) they receive without causing side effects.

### Example Component (Concept)

A component might:

* Accept props for customization (like text, style, or callback functions).
* Render content dynamically based on props or internal state.
* Be used across multiple parts of the application for consistent UI behavior.

---

## ⚙️ Props

Props (short for *properties*) allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component.

### Purpose.

* Enable **component reusability** with different data.
* Allow **dynamic rendering** without rewriting logic.
* Keep the UI and data **decoupled** and flexible.

### Common Patterns

* Destructure props for cleaner code.
* Use default values for optional props.
* Validate prop types using **PropTypes** or **TypeScript interfaces**.

### Example (Concept)

A component might receive props such as:

* `label`: Text to display.
* `onClick`: Function to handle actions.
* `type`: Variant for styling.
* `disabled`: Boolean to control interactivity.

### Best Practices

* Pass only the required data.
* Avoid deeply nested props (consider context or hooks instead).
* Keep prop names descriptive and consistent.

---

## 🪝 Custom Hooks

Custom hooks encapsulate **reusable logic** that can be shared across components without repeating code.

### 📁 Folder Structure

```
src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useFetch.js
│   ├── useToggle.js
│   └── ...
```

### Purpose

* Encapsulate common logic such as fetching data, handling form inputs, or managing UI state.
* Start every custom hook name with `use` to follow React conventions.
* Keep hooks independent — they should not rely on specific components.

### Examples of Common Hooks (Concept)

* `useFetch` — handles API requests and manages loading/error states.
* `useToggle` — manages boolean state (e.g., toggling visibility).
* `useLocalStorage` — synchronizes state with local storage.

### Best Practices

* Ensure hooks are **pure and predictable**.
* Avoid side effects inside hooks unless properly handled (e.g., inside `useEffect`).
* Return clear, minimal, and meaningful data from hooks.

## 🧠 Summary

| Category      | Purpose                    | Example Concept                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Component** | UI Building Block          | A reusable button or card layout  |
| **Prop**      | Data passed to a component | Label, color, click event handler |
| **Hook**      | Reusable logic             | Data fetching or state management |

---

## 🧾 Best Practices

* Keep components **simple and focused** — one responsibility per component.
* Use **props** to customize behavior, not to overload components with logic.
* Move repetitive logic into **custom hooks** for maintainability.
* Maintain consistent **naming conventions** across the project.
* Organize files logically — components, hooks, and utilities should live in separate folders.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **React (v18+)** — UI library.
* **Vite / CRA** — Development and bundling.
* **CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS** — Styling system.
* **PropTypes / TypeScript** — Type safety and validation.
